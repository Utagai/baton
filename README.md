# baton ðŸª„

Baton is a tiny little web app for _ephemeral_ file storage & transfer. Namely,
it lets you upload files that sit on the server for some finite amount of time,
after which it is deleted. In this time, you can delete them manually or
download them.

Personally, I use this to transfer files across my various devices by visiting
wherever this is hosted. One of the main reasons this was made was to help me
learn web development, and solve a problem of mine with a tool I write myself
instead of using something else.

This project does not aim to solve the problem it addresses (or any other
problems) in a way that 'beats' the competition. I could likely have used some
other service that solves this issue just fine, but there's a certain joy in
building your own tools.
